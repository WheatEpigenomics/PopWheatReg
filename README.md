# PopWheatReg
Population-scale integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility, gene expression and regulatory variation underlying spike development and agronomic traits in polyploid wheat.

Noncoding regulatory variation is a major driver of phenotypic diversity in crops, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain difficult to resolve in large and polyploid genomes such as bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). In particular, how genetic variants influence chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and agronomic traits through local and long-range regulatory interactions is still poorly understood at the population scale.

In this project, we generated a population-scale chromatin accessibility atlas of wheat spikes by profiling over 200 globally diverse accessions using ATAC-seq, together with matched RNA-seq and whole-genome resequencing data for a subset of accessions. By integrating chromatin accessibility, gene expression, genetic variation and population structure, we systematically characterized the regulatory landscape underlying spike development and agronomic trait variation in polyploid wheat.

This repository contains custom scripts and analysis pipelines used to:

identify accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and quantify their population-level variation,

map chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) and expression QTLs (eQTLs),

construct local ACR–gene regulatory links (agLinks) and distal chromatin co-accessibility networks (coACRs),

integrate regulatory mapping results with GWAS, TWAS and caWAS analyses to infer causal regulatory variants,

and characterize transcription factor–mediated regulatory logic across subgenomes and subpopulations.

Together, these analyses provide a framework for dissecting how noncoding regulatory variation shapes gene expression and complex traits in a polyploid crop genome. The scripts in this repository were developed to support reproducible population-scale regulatory analyses and may be adapted for similar studies in other plant species.
